# 💡 Logic Design 2DI4 – Lab Reports

This repository contains a collection of completed lab assignments from the **Logic Design (ELECENG 2DI4)** course at McMaster University. Each lab explores foundational concepts in digital logic through hands-on implementation with circuits, HDL (Verilog), and testing on hardware such as CPLDs and FPGAs.
